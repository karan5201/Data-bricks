**Situation:** Needed a streamlined stock data pipeline for analysis. 📈

**Task:** Build a PySpark pipeline in Azure Databricks to ingest, clean, and transform stock data for visualization.

**Action:** I used Databricks to:
*   Fetch stock data from Alpha Vantage API. ☁️
*   Clean data by handling missing values and duplicates. ✨
*   Calculate key features like percentage change and moving averages. 📊
*   Save transformed data as a Delta table. ✅

**Result:** Successfully created a clean, enriched dataset ready for immediate analysis in any visualization tool. This project honed my skills in PySpark, data engineering, and cloud-based data processing, paving the way for impactful data-driven insights! 🚀 #AzureDatabricks #PySpark #DataEngineering #StockMarket #DataVisualization
